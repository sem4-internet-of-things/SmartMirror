# SmartMirror Synopsis

In this project we're going to make a *SmartMirror* - A mirror that can display date, time, weather and a personal message.

Our goals for this project:
- The SmartMirror should display date and time.
- The SmartMirror should display the weather report for the next 3 days.
- The SmartMirror should display a RSS-feed.
- The SmartMirror should have a sensor, that. detects and turns on the SmartMirror when a person is infront of it.

We're to use a Raspberry-Pi for this projekt. On it we're going to have a website that displays the desired information. This projekt has alot of
opportunities to, future develop - For example, we could incorporate a remote or button, to switch between different view styles. In addition we could also implement voice activision with Google Cloud Speech or Amazon Alexa.

There's endless oppetunites when it comes to modules for this project. There's plenty of different guides on internet.
