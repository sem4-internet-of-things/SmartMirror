# SmartMirror Synopsis

In this project we're going to make a *SmartMirror* - A mirror that can display date, time, weather and a personal message.

Our goals for this project:
- The SmartMirror should display date and time.
- The SmartMirror should display the weather report for the next 3 days.
- The SmartMirror should display a RSS-feed.
- The SmartMirror should have a sensor, that. detects and turns on the SmartMirror when a person is infront of it.

We're to use a Raspberry-Pi for this projekt. On it we're going to have a website that displays the desired information. This projekt has alot of
opportunities to, future develop - For example, we could incorporate:
- a remote or button, to switch between different view styles,
